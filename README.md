# Student-Performance-Predictor
Student Performance Predictor using data mining
This project applies data mining techniques to analyze and predict student performance using synthetic educational data. It explores patterns in student behavior, attendance, demographics, and academic history to forecast final exam results and identify at-risk students.
Objectives:
Preprocess and clean raw student data

Discover hidden patterns using clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)

Build predictive models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)

Visualize key performance indicators (KPI)

Provide insights for intervention strategies

📊 Dataset:
A synthetic dataset of 1000 students with fields like:

diff
Copy
Edit
- Student ID
- Gender
- Age
- Class (Grade)
- Attendance Rate (%)
- Parent Education Level
- Internet Access at Home (Yes/No)
- Past GPA
- Hours of Study per Week
- Participation in Extracurriculars (Yes/No)
- Final Exam Score (0-100)
